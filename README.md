# Smart-Garden
The Smart Garden project at the Electrical Systems Laboratory (ENIT) focused on creating an automated and sustainable garden management system. It integrated solar-powered batteries for energy, automatic irrigation, and remote monitoring through a mobile application, promoting efficient resource use and sustainability.

This repository contains the full Arduino code, the application APK, and the project report for our smart garden system, which is divided into four key components:

Charger Boards: Adjusts power supply voltage from batteries (+12V/+24V) to match PCS chargers (+20V) and phone chargers (+5V).
Power Supply: Powered by solar panel-charged batteries, supplying energy to the system.
Control Cabinet: Houses the control board, managing automatic irrigation, lighting, and the Battery Management System (BMS).
Application: Monitors the system and controls both irrigation and lighting remotely.
